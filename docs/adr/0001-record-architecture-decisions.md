Technical Story: [issue #1](https://github.com/subscription-buddy/issues/1)

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to record architectural decisions made in this project.

## Decision Drivers

* We want to keep a history of decisions.
* We want to be able to look up why a decision was made.
* We want to avoid debating the same topic over and over again.

## Considered Options

* MADR
* Michael Nygard's template
* Sustainable Architectural Decisions

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Michael Nygard's template", because it is simple and sufficient for our needs.

### Positive Consequences

* We have a standard format for decisions.

### Negative Consequences

* We need to learn the format.

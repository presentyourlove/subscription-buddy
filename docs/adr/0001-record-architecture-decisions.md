Date: 2026-01-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record architecture decisions to help new team members understand the history of the project and to prevent revisiting old decisions without new context.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to track these decisions.
We will use Markdown Format.

## Consequences

* We will have a history of decisions.
* We need to maintain these records.
